# **Advanced Video Downloader**

This repository contains a Python script that allows you to download videos from various websites, including those with dynamically loaded content. The script uses `Selenium` to handle JavaScript-heavy pages, supports multiple video formats, and includes a progress bar to track download progress.

## **Features**

- **Dynamic Content Handling**: Uses Selenium WebDriver to handle websites with dynamically loaded content.
- **Multiple Video Formats**: Supports downloading videos in common formats such as `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.ogg`, `.mkv`, and `.m3u8`.
- **Automatic Filename Generation**: Generates a descriptive filename based on the webpage title.
- **Progress Bar**: Displays a progress bar during video download for real-time feedback.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling for a more robust and reliable experience.

## **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Chrome WebDriver (compatible with your version of Chrome)

### **Python Packages**

Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 selenium tqdm
```

## **Setup**

1. **Download Chrome WebDriver**: 

   - Download the Chrome WebDriver from the official [Chromium site](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) and make sure it matches your installed version of Chrome.
   - Add the Chrome WebDriver to your system's PATH or place it in the same directory as your script.

2. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-video-downloader.git
   cd advanced-video-downloader
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:

   ```bash
   python video_downloader.py
   ```

## **Usage**

To use the script, simply pass the URL of the webpage containing the video you want to download:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    website_url = "https://www.example.com"  # Replace with the URL of the webpage containing the video
    main(website_url)
```

1. **Replace** `"https://www.example.com"` with the actual URL of the webpage from which you want to download the video.
2. **Run the Script**. The video will be downloaded to the `./downloads` directory, with a filename based on the webpage title.

## **Customization**

- **Output Directory**: You can change the output directory by modifying the `output_dir` variable in the `main` function.
- **Additional Formats**: If you need to support additional video formats, simply add them to the `video_formats` list in the `get_video_url_selenium` function.

## **Legal and Ethical Considerations**

- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with the terms of service and copyright laws when downloading content from the web. This script is intended for educational purposes, and you should only use it where you have the right to download content.
- **Respect Policies**: Some websites have measures in place to prevent automated downloading. It's important to respect these policies.
